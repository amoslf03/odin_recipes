    <p> Today I'm going to help you make this delicious looking ham. I'm assuming you're not muslim because you
        would be breaking some rules eating this delicious food. For those of you that are confused by my statement,
        in the Islamic culture, it is forbidden to eat pork. </p>

    <p> For those of us that can enjoy this dish, I'm here to help you out. If you do get bored while waiting for
        your dish to get out of the oven, you can read more about the Islamic culture and the Muslim religion right

    <h3> Ingredients </h3>
    <p> Here are the list of Ingredients you will need to make this yummy dish. </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li> 1 (12 pound) bone-in ham </li>
        <li> ½ cup whole cloves </li>
        <li> 1 (20 ounce) can pineapple rings in heavy syrup </li>
        <li> ½ cup packed brown sugar </li>
        <li> 1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle lemon-lime flavored carbonated beverage </li>
        <li> 1 (4 ounce) jar chopped maraschino cherries </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Instructions </h3>
    <p> Follow the Instructions below to make this dish but don't be afraid to add your own twist to it. </p>

    <ol>
        <li> Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (160 degrees C). </li>
        <li> Place ham in a roasting pan. Score the rind of the ham with a diamond pattern. Press a clove
        into the center of each diamond. Drain the juice from the pineapple rings into a medium bowl, and
        stir in the brown sugar and lemon-lime soda. Coat the ham with this mixture. Arrange the pineapple
        rings over the outside of the ham. Place a maraschino cherry in the center of each pineapple ring,
        and secure with a toothpick.
        </li>
        <li> Bake uncovered for 4 to 5 hours, basting frequently with the juices, until the internal temperature
        of the ham is 160 degrees F (72 degrees C). Be sure the meat thermometer is not touching the bone. 
        Remove toothpicks before serving. 
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p> Great work on making this dish without burning the house down. Now have you a slice of that pineapple to
        celebrate. Just don't let anyone see you stick your dirty fingers on the food.

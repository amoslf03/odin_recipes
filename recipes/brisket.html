    <p> You clicked on this page because you were hungry for some Hanukkah
        Brisket. What makes it Hanukkah, you ask? I have no idea. I don't
        celebrate Hanukkah and so I don't know. But one thing I do know is
        that you're going to love this sh*t.
    </p>
    <p> With that being said, let's give some homework to the curious minds
        that want to know what <a href="https://www.chabad.org/holidays/chanukah/article_cdo/aid/102911/jewish/What-Is-Hanukkah.htm"> Hanukkah</a> 
        is and how it is celebrated. For the rest of us lazy folks. Let's start
        cooking but remember to save those curious minds a plate for when they're done reading.
    </p>

    <h3> Ingredients </h3>
    <p> Here are the list of Ingredients you're going to need to make amazing dish. </p>

    <ul>
        <li> 1 (4 pound) beef brisket </li>
        <li> 1 large onion, sliced </li>
        <li> 2 (14.5 ounce) cans beef broth </li>
        <li> 2 (15 ounce) cans French onion soup </li>
        <li> 3 (12 fluid ounce) cans or bottles beer (one to drink while cooking) </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Instructions </h3>
    <p> To make this delicious meal, please follow the directions below...or don't. Some people
        like nasty food during the holidays.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li> Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). </li>
        <li> Place a large roasting pan over medium-high heat and
            sear beef brisket, fat side down at first, until browned
            on all sides, about 3 minutes per side. Remove brisket and set aside. </li>
        <li> Place onion slices into the bottom of the roasting pan; pour 1 can beef broth,
            1 can French onion soup, and 1 can beer over the onions.</li>
        <li> Lay the brisket into the roasting pan; pour remaining cans of beef broth,
            french onion soup, and beer over the brisket. Cover the roasting
            pan with a lid. </li>
        <li> Bake in the preheated oven for 3 hours. Remove from oven
            and let stand for 30 minutes. </li>
        <li> Remove cooled brisket from roasting pan and wrap tightly
            in aluminum foil. Pour pan juices and onion into a food storage container and cover
            tightly with a lid. Refrigerate beef and pan juices overnight. </li>
        <li> The next day, preheat ovn to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Pour pan juices and onion
            into a 9x13-inch baking dish. </li>
        <li> Unwrap the brisket, cut away any visible fat, and slice thinly across the grain of the
            meat. Place brisket slices into the pan juices. </li>
        <li> Return to oven and bake until pan juices are thickened and meat is hot, about 45 more minutes. </li>
        <li> Remove from oven and enjoy. Hopefully, you know to let it cool so you don't burn your tongue (unless that's how you like your food). </li>
    </ol>

    <p> Now that you're done cooking your meal, take your time to admire it before devouring it like the pig you are. </p>

    <p> You clicked on this page because you were hungry for some Hanukkah
        Brisket. What makes it Hanukkah, you ask? I have no idea. I don't
        celebrate Hanukkah and so I don't know. But one thing I do know is
        that you're going to love this sh*t.
    </p>
    <p> With that being said, let's give some homework to the curious minds
        that want to know what Hanukkah is and how it is celebrated. For the
        rest of us lazy folks. Let's start cooking but remember to save those
        curious minds a plate for when they're done read.

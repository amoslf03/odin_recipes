    <p> Now I know what you're thinking. This is not even a holiday dish. Guess what, I don't give
        a darn. So you can go f*** your mouth with this delicious salmon.
    </p>

    <p> Now that we got that out of the way, we can start. To be fair, you're right. Salmon is not
        really a holiday dish but you can't deny that it always taste good no matter how you make it,
        unless you're my brother, then you might as well eat dirt. Plus salmon is one of my favorite
        sea food and it will soon be yours.
    </p>

    <h3> Ingredients </h3>
    <p> Here are the list of things you'll need to make it not turn out like my brother's cooking. </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li> 3 tablespoons Dijon mustard </li>
        <li> 3 tablespoons butter, melted </li>
        <li> 5 teaspoons honey </li>
        <li> ½ cup fresh bread crumbs </li>
        <li> ½ cup finely chopped pecans </li>
        <li> 3 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley </li>
        <li> 6 (4 ounce) fillets salmon </li>
        <li> salt and pepper to taste </li>
        <li> 6 lemon wedges </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Instructions </h3>
    <p> Here is how to make this tasty salmon in 3 long a** steps. </p>

    <ol>
        <li> Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). In a small bowl, mix together the mustard,
            butter, and honey. In another bowl, mix together the bread crumbs, pecans, and parsley. </li>
        <li> Season each salmon fillet with salt and pepper. Place on a lightly greased baking sheet. 
            Brush with mustard-honey mixture. Cover the top of each fillet with bread crumb mixture. </li>
        <li> Bake for 10 minutes per inch of thickness, measured at thickest part, or until salmon just
            flakes when tested with a fork. Serve garnished with lemon wedges. </li>
    </ol>

    <p> Now that you're done with your piece of art, don't forget to snap a picture of it and let the world
        see what a master chef you are...unless it turned out like my brother's cooking. In that case, bury
        that sh*t in the deep end of the garbage can and never speak a word of it. And don't forget to talk to me through the sky and let me
        know that salmon is now your favorite sea food.
